# TODO

1. implement `compile = compileWith(options)` correctly
1. implement compiler directives
1. add `option` to forbid compiler directives in source
1. side effects? keywords for magic things like print to console? maybe just give `stdin` and `stdout` preloaded?
1. better error messages ( don't we actually already have an index into the current string for that? )
1. compiler debugging output dependent on log level
